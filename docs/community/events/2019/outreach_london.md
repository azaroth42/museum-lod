## Description

We welcome all those working with digital cultural heritage data to join us for a day of exploration and discussion about Linked Art on the 1st October 2019, hosted by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Linked Art is an international community working together to create a shared Linked Data model to describe art and artworks. At this event, supported by the AHRC-funded Linked Art Research Network, we will introduce the model and its uses, and engage with individuals and institutions who are positioned to adopt the model. All are welcome, and we encourage the attendance and contribution of curators, collection managers, educators, museum technologists, and researchers whose studies include digital collections. 

The first half of the day will present an overview of work-to-date on the Linked Art model, including its use, benefits, implementation, and challenges of Linked Open Usable Data in an art museum environment. This will include examples of how the Linked Art model is being used to publish collections data.

The subsequent afternoon session will switch to a workshop format, with smaller focussed groups discussing the uses and potential of Linked Art. We anticipate discussion groups will consider topics such as catalogues, provenance, exhibitions, citations, educational materials, and academic scholarship, along with any other relevant themes proposed by those present. While the focus of the current Linked Art model is artworks, art provenance, and art history, we foresee future opportunities for extending the model -- and applying the principles and practices it embodies -- across wider cultural heritage data scenarios. Discussion of these broader possibilities will also be accommodated during break-out sessions.

Members of the Linked Art Editorial Board will participate in group discussions, giving attendees the opportunity to reflect upon applications which interest them most with those who know the model best, sharing experiences and best practice. Furthermore, the insights gathered from attendees will be used to inform potential future revisions and extensions of the Linked Art model, and identify opportunities for new collaborations and research. 

The day will finish in plenary with summaries from the discussion groups, followed by informal social events in the evening, to which everyone is invited to attend.

## Related Event: Linked Conservation Data workshop
	 	 	
Linked Conservation Data (LCD) is a Network of partners funded under the same AHRC programme as Linked Art. The aim of the Network is to discuss and report on ways that conservation documentation can be disseminated and re-used more effectively through Linked Data.

The [next LCD workshop](https://www.ligatus.org.uk/lcd/meeting/modelling) will focus on data modelling, and will take place on 12-13 September 2019 in London, UK. During this workshop participants will model typical cases of conservation data and will propose guidelines on best practices for encoding conservation documentation records based on the CIDOC-CRM. Conservation domain expertise and sample conservation data are needed. Please circulate this to conservation colleagues in your institution.

Registration is now open at [https://forms.gle/eh96yn5ogxQ6VNdF8](https://forms.gle/eh96yn5ogxQ6VNdF8). The deadline for registrations 16 August 2019.
