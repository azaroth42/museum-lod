## Introduction

This is a living document that tries to capture the current set of frequently used vocabulary terms across organizations and projects. The lists of terms are not intended to be complete or all-encompassing, but starting points to use in data production and software development.

The data model does not require the use of these terms, or any other specific terms, however if there is reasonably widespread re-use of the same terms, then that gives a good indication that they are valuable and understandable.  As such, if they are broadly adopted, the process of mapping real data into the model and the development of both server and client software that implements the model for users becomes significantly easier.

If the term plus class is not self-evident as to how it should be used in the model, then a description of its usage is provided in the tables below. This should not be confused with the scope notes or description of the term itself ... it applies to the usage in the linked.art context, rather than being a general description of the concept.

!!! warning "This should (still, somehow) be auto-generated from data, and use emerging consensus.  The current starter lists are from the Getty Provenance Index, Getty Museum, and the American Art Collaborative data."

## Classifications

These classifications used to futher clarify the type of a resource.  The reference is found in the `classified_as` property of the resource. The lists are divided up per class of resource, given in the `type` property.  In general, please see the [common patterns](/model/base/).


### ManMadeObject

The most common classification used for art is the type of artwork.  The two lists below are divided into primarily visual works such as paintings and sculpture, separate from broad classes of man-made objects that are displayed. Please see [Object Types](/model/object/identity/#types).

### PhysicalObject

Things take two roles within the model, as parts of objects (such as the support or a frame) and for aggregations such as a collection or auction lot. Please see [parts of objects](/model/object/physical/#parts) and [collections](/model/collection/) respectively.

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |

```crom
top = vocab.AuctionLotSet()
top._label = "Set of Objects in an Auction Lot"
```

### LinguisticObject

These classifications are used to further describe the intent of a piece of text associated with some resource. Please see the [shared statements pattern](/model/base/#statements-about-a-resource).

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |

```

### InformationObject

InformationObjects are classified primarily according to their function, such as an auction catalog versus an exhibition catalog.

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |

```

### Place

Places are also classified primarily according to the function that typically takes place there. Please see the model for [places](/model/place/).

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |

 _aat:300077989_ | purchasing           | For Acquisitions that involve money

```crom
top = Auction()
top._label = "Example Auction"
```

### Identifier

There are many specific types of identifiers, sometimes called "identifier schemes".  The set below are not specific schemes such as DOIs or Lugt Numbers, but general classes of identifier usage.  Broadly adopted identifier schemes will be included when there is data to support the extent of adoption.

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
 _aat:300312355_ | accession numbers    | 
 _aat:300404621_ | repository numbers   | 
 _aat:300404628_ | lot numbers          | For auction lot identifiers
 _aat:300412177_ | stock numbers        |

Example:


```crom
top = AccessionNumber()
top.content = "P2005.12.276"
```


### Name

Unlike Identifiers, Names are normally classified only once they have been divided into parts.  The classification represents the nature of the part of the name, relative to the whole.

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
 _aat:300404651_ | first names          |
 _aat:300404652_ | last names           |
 _aat:300404654_ | middle names         |
 _aat:300404662_ | suffixes             |
 _aat:300404845_ | prefixes             |

```crom
top = vocab.GivenName()
top.content = "Example"
```

### Dimension

Dimensions are classified to represent the relationship between the value and the object being measured. Please see the section on [object dimensions](/model/object/physical/#dimensions).

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
 _aat:300055644_ | height               |
 _aat:300055647_ | width                |
 _aat:300072633_ | depth                |
 _aat:300055624_ | diameter             |
 _aat:300056240_ | weight               |

```crom
top = vocab.Height()
top.value = 24
```



## Instances

Vocabulary terms are also used as the identifier for particular instances of classes, rather than to be more specific about their type.  For example, _aat:300111188_ is the identifier for the Group of people that could be considered as French. This Group could be further classified as a _aat:300379842_ Nationality.

### Group

Groups are used for many groups of people, however nationalities and genders are commonly recorded consistently across datasets.

| AAT Term       | Label                | Usage Notes                   |

 _aat:300189559_ | male                 |

```crom
