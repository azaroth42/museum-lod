## Introduction

This section accommodates information about activities typically undertaken as part of the care and conservation of objects.

Other sections of the Linked.Art model also relate to conservation:

* Sampling activity is described under [Production by removal](/model/object/production/#production-by-removal).
* Recommending environmental conditions for a collection item is described under [Object physical characteristics](/model/object/physical/#environmental-conditions)
* Flagging hazardous material is described under [Object physical characteristics - Materials](/model/object/physical/#materials) and under [Object physical characteristics - Hazardous Materials Statements](model/object/physical/index.html#hazardous-materials-statements)

## Conservation Activity

Conservation Activities are wrapper activities which represent the context of more granular events, and represent the overall event that is tracked in the chain, rather than the specific legal and physical changes that affect one or more objects. For example, a condition check of a collection which involves checking multiple objects, or conservation activity which starts with a condition check and continues with interventive conservation work. 

Conservation Activities have all of the regular properties and relationships, as documented in the [baseline patterns](/model/base/). In particular, the relationships to actors, places and time reflect the overall event, and can be further specified in the separate parts if they are different and known.  

__Example:__

The conservation work undertaken at the Museum on an object in late April 2002. The details about the condition assessment and the interventive conservation would be given using parts including `AttributeAssignment` and `Modification` respectively, and described in more detail in subsequent sections.

```crom
top = vocab.Conserving(ident="auto int-per-segment", label="Conservation of Object")
top.identified_by = vocab.LocalNumber(value="cons-2002-0005")
museum = vocab.MuseumOrg(label="Museum")
top.carried_out_by = museum
ts = model.TimeSpan()
ts.begin_of_the_begin = "2002-04-19T00:00:00Z"
ts.end_of_the_end = "2002-04-26T00:00:00Z"
top.timespan = ts
cond = model.AttributeAssignment(label="Condition Assessment")
cons = model.Modification(label="Interventive Conservation Work")
top.part = cond
top.part = cons
```

## Condition Assessment

Condition Assessment describes an activity during which an object is examined and its preservation condition or types of damage are identified. The condition type is assigned as classification to the object. 

__Example:__

The condition assessment of an object.

```crom
top = model.AttributeAssignment(ident="auto int-per-segment", label="Condition Assessment of Object")
ts = model.TimeSpan()
ts.begin_of_the_begin = "2002-04-19T00:00:00Z"
ts.end_of_the_end = "2002-04-26T00:00:00Z"
top.timespan = ts
actor = model.Person(label="Conservator")
top.carried_out_by = actor

# Should this be a Type ?
# Replaced has_note, which is terrible
top.referred_to_by = vocab.Description(content="Regular condition check")

# Should this be Description, or assigned?
# -- replaced ConservationStatement to get it to deploy
conds = vocab.Description()
conds.content = "Fine cracks throughout the object (crizzling)"
top.referred_to_by = conds
doc = vocab.Description(label="Condition Assessment Report")
# Reduced documented_in --> subject_of
top.subject_of = doc
top.assigned = vocab.instances['crizzling']

# Should there be top.assigned_property_type "some-property-here?" ?

obj = model.HumanMadeObject(label="Glass Vessel")
top.assigned_to = obj

```

## Conservation Work

Conservation Work refers to the activities undertaken on an object before exhibition or with the objective to prevent the object from deteriorating. 

__Example:__

Repair of a manuscript board.

```crom
top = model.Modification(ident="auto int-per-segment", label="Condition Assessment of Object")
ts = model.TimeSpan()
ts.begin_of_the_begin = "2002-04-19T00:00:00Z"
ts.end_of_the_end = "2002-04-26T00:00:00Z"
top.timespan = ts
actor = model.Person(label="Conservator")
top.carried_out_by = actor
# See previous example's comments
top.referred_to_by = vocab.Description(content="Planned conservation work in response to earlier survey")
cons = vocab.Description()
cons.content = "Board consolidation and re-attachment"
top.referred_to_by = cons
doc = vocab.Description(label="Conservation Report")
top.subject_of = doc
top.employed = vocab.instances['thread']
obj = model.HumanMadeObject(label="Manuscript")
top.modified = obj

```
