title: Linked Art Data Model
---

The desired target model for Linked Open Data in the Art domain is one with the following properties:

* Captures as much of the information that we know about the resources as possible
* Can be productively used via easy to implement [services](/api/)
* Provides interoperability with other related data sets
* Solves actual challenges, which are documented as use cases

Successful models are developed:

* iteratively (we will not get it right the first time)
* responsively (we will change the model in response to feedback and concerns)
* responsibly (we will consider changes and features carefully with respect to complexity and value)
* collaboratively (we will engage with the community, projects and individuals early and often)

## Model Fundamentals

Following the existing norms of the community, our starting point consists of:

* [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) as the core ontology, giving an event-based paradigm
* The [Getty Vocabularies](http://vocab.getty.edu/) as core sources of identity
* [JSON-LD](jsonld/) as the primary target serialization

These are then expanded from if necessary in order to fulfil shared use cases and common requirements.

## Model Components

The model can be treated as interlinking components that describe aspects of the events of interest. The target context for JSON-LD is described first, as the examples within the other documentation use it for readability.

* [Target Serialization](jsonld/)
* [Shared Patterns](base/)
* [Object Description](object/)
* [Object Provenance](provenance/)
* [Actors](actor/) (People, Organizations)
* [Places](place/)
* [Collections](collection/)
* [Exhibitions](exhibition/)
* [Primary Sources](documents/) of information
* [Dataset Description](dataset/)
* [Sources of Identity](vocab/)
* [CRM Class Analysis](class_analysis/)

## Scope Limitations

* Complex Bibliography
    * The description of bibliographic resources in Linked Data is the subject of several ongoing discussions in the Library domain. We feel that the Art and Museum community should adopt whatever solution is devised by the experts in that field.
* Data Provenance 
    * Recording the individual events in which the data itself is created, modified and managed is out of scope of this work. The global Linked Open Data community has various approaches to this problem, with varying degrees of complexity and accuracy. Given the relative infancy of the work in the Art domain, we feel that adding this is an unnecessary burden at this stage at any level below the entire dataset. 
* Quantification of Uncertainty
    * Similarly, the degree of certainty about the data being expressed is valuable and of interest to researchers, but requires a significantly more complex environment. This would also prove an unsustainable burden, and is impractical to use even if it were provided.
